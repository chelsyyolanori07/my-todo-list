This todo list project is done, and honestly this project is my way to learn react jsðŸ§¾ <br>
Thanks to ed sensei again who teach and help me to finish this project, hope God will give his kindness back billionfold :) <br>

In my silly todo list you can use some of the features that available which are:<br>
1. Add your todo list and stuff following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) <br>
2. There's also a mini timer feature you can set up and it will give you notification once it times up <br>
3. Sorting tasks by importancy (scale 1-4) and tags feature <br>
4. You can also set deadline for each task and your task name will change color once it's exceed your deadline <br>
5. Lastly there's also mini help guide to 'How to use this todo list app' in case you want to know more feel free to read it there <br>

I guess that's it lol i hope it can be useful for some people so feel free to use this in case you encouter this repo hahaha once again thank you so much for visiting my silly lil project repo i really appreaciate it. Lastly have a great day/night :)
